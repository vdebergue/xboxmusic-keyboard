xboxmusic-keyboard
==================

A chrome plugin in development to control music.xbox.com with keyboard. Why ? Because keyboard is cool :D

Available shortcuts
-------------------
- `space` Toggle play/pause
- `alt+left` Previous Track
- `alt+right` Next Track
- `alt++ alt+up` Volume up
- `alt+- alt+down` Volume down
- `alt+c` Go to Collection
- `alt+r` Go to Radio
- `alt+n` Go to Now Playing
- `/` Focus on search input

I use [jQuery Hotkeys](https://github.com/jeresig/jquery.hotkeys) to manage key bindings
